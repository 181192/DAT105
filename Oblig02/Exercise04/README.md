# Exercise 4 - Graph methods
In this exercise, you are to work with the code from Lecture 17.


### a)
Implement the methods removeVertex and removeEdge.


### b)
Add and implement the method void breadthFirstTraversal(Node* n);


### c)
Add and implement the method primsAlgorithm() that uses Prim's algoritms to find a
minimum spanning tree and returns a vector containing the edges that defines the MST.
